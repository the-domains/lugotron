About Antonio Lugo-Ponce

Born and raised in Austin, Texas, Antonio found himself surrounded with great influences, both cultural and environmental, to feel confident enough to pursue a creative career in media arts. 

Antonio's work embraces human nature. His understanding of what we we're capable of reflects the lives of everyday, hard working people he writes about. He gives intriguing insight to the stresses we as Americans tend to put on ourselves through our daily lives, all while telling us that if we truly embraced who we are, we'd be better because of it.
